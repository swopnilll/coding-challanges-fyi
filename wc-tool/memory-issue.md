```py
content = file.read()
```

### **Why Does This Load the Entire File in Memory?**

- `file.read()` **reads the entire file at once** and stores it in the `content` variable as a **bytes object**.
- If the file is **large**, this can lead to **high memory usage**, potentially causing performance issues or running out of memory.

### **How to Make It More Memory-Efficient?**

Instead of reading the entire file at once, you can **process it line by line**, which is especially useful for large files.

#### **Optimized Version (Line-by-Line Processing)**

Modify the `-l` (line count) case to read the file line-by-line:

```py
case '-l':
    with open(filename, "rb") as file:
        lineCount = sum(1 for _ in file)  # Efficient line counting
    print(f"{lineCount} {filename}")

```

✅ This avoids loading the entire file into memory by **reading one line at a time**.

`lineCount = sum(1 for _ in file)`

This line is **counting the number of lines** in the file efficiently, without loading the entire file into memory. Here's how it works:

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  **`for _ in file`**

    - This loops over the file **line by line**.
    - In Python, when you iterate over a file (`for line in file`), it automatically reads one line at a time.
    - The **underscore (`_`)** is used as a variable name when we don't actually need the value of the line.

2.  **`1 for _ in file`**

    - This is called a **generator expression**.
    - For each line in the file, it **yields the number `1`** (since we are counting lines, we just need a `1` for each line).

3.  **`sum(...)`**

    - The `sum()` function adds up all the `1`s generated by the expression.
    - The total sum gives the **total number of lines in the file**.

### **Example**

#### **Suppose `test.txt` contains:**

```bash
Hello
World
Python is great!
```

#### **How Python Processes the Line:**

`sum(1 for _ in file)`

- Reads `"Hello\n"` → **yields `1`**
- Reads `"World\n"` → **yields `1`**
- Reads `"Python is great!\n"` → **yields `1`**
- `sum(1, 1, 1) → 3`

### **Equivalent Traditional Approach (Without Generator Expression)**

The same logic written in a more traditional way:

```py
lineCount = 0
for line in file:
    lineCount += 1
```

✅ Both approaches give the same result, but the generator expression (`sum(1 for _ in file)`) is **more concise and memory-efficient**.

---

### **Why is This Efficient?**

- **Does NOT load the entire file into memory**.
- **Processes one line at a time**, so it works well for large files.
- **More readable and concise** compared to a full `for` loop.
